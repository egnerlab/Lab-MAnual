You get a credit card to spend money from Tobias' research funds! How cool is that? The credit card is called a pcard, short for "procurement card" (or corporate card). It is used probably most often for paying participants in our MTurk studies, but it gets used for most of the other miscellaneous expenses the lab has, too. That includes

* Expenses for traveling to conferences
    * Flights
    * Conference registration
    * Conference society membership
    * Hotels/AirBnbs
* MTurk receipts
* Lab supplies


If any expense in your expense report is charged to one of Tobias' fund codes, you'll need to attach a generic email from Tobias that says, as his lab manager, you're approved to make payments on his behalf.

Ask for a name of the study for every MTurk receipt. It doesn't have to be the final name that gets used in a manuscript, it's just for tracking purposese for the cashier's office. You'll list this name in the comments section of the expense report. You'll also need to inlcude an additional sentence if a study is charged to one of Tobias' grants. According to Diane Masters, who is one of the approvers for receipts, it should say something along the lines of, ""


Almost always, several people stay together during a conference. More often than not they're from our lab, but not always. Regardless, you can ask Tobias which fund code is paying for each person's expenses. Typically conference travel gets paid for by Tobias' discretionary fund (like his general, non-tied-down pool of money), but sometimes his grants might pay for them. More recently, people have charged travel receipts to internals funds, like the CNAP travel fund and Charles Lafitte Fund. Every CNAP student is entitled to $500 in expenses for conference attendance for each of their first two years (though oddly, sometimes that can't go to conference society membership; talk to Robin Knott for more details). Often that $500 isn't enough to pay for a whole trip, so one's receipts might be split between multiple fund codes. The Charles Lafitte Fund, on the other hand, gives out travel grant awards for graduate and undergraduate students that sponsors all costs for conferences, though they only do so sometimes and it can be unclear when. Obviously, Tobias prefers CNAP and the Lafitte funds paying for lab members' expenses whenever possible instead of him. (Side note- we've learned the hard way that the Lafitte grant won't fund any lodging expense for undergrads who stay in an Airbnb. So make sure if an undergrad does get Lafitte funding they stay in a hotel.)

Duke is pushing for all purchases to be from affiliated vendors on Work@Duke if possible. So do check Staples and CDW for lab supplies before moving on to other sites.
