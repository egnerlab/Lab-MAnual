# JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

##  Purpose & Outline

The goal of this folder is to provide helpful resources and suggestions while learning JavaScript/HTML/CSS, as well as designating some general conventions and best practices for coding styles.

------------------------------------------

## JavaScript

[JavaScript](http://javascript.info/intro) is a dynamic language which can be used to make MTurk experiments or creating websites with interactive features. While HTML provides the basic structure of a site and CSS the formatting, JavaScript allows you to present stimuli, record reaction times, respond to user inputs, etc.

Recommended:
* Free Online [JavaScript Textbook](https://javascript.info/)
* [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/)
    * Alternative to jquery. It is easier to use in general but offers less flexibility and power.
* [Canvas tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)
    * Canvas is a special HTML element which you can use to show stimuli with scripting. It is more flexible/dynamic than using html elements. Definitely worth checking out.
* [MTurk Tutorial](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/) by Timothy Brady.
    * This is MTurk specific, but great all around resource for learning the basics of JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

Others:
* This [comprehensive tutorial](https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/web-experiments.html)
* Duke's [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web)
* Codecademy's JavaScript [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* w3schools.com's [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* As always, remember to look up problems you have on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)!

>Note: If you have never programmed before, start with the resources under 'Others'. They are more approachable and will teach you the basics of programming along with JavaScript. There are tons of these tutorials out there; find one you like!

------------------------------------------

## HTML

HTML, or 'Hyper Text Markup Language', describes the content of websites. You can have HTML content that appears on the webpage (such as a picture or a paragraph of text) or HTML content that does not appear but contains things like JavaScript code.

Resources:

* wr3school's [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
* This very basic [beginner's guide](https://www.quicksprout.com/beginners-guide-to-html/)
* Many of the JavaScript and MTurk resources also cover HTML, for example this Stanford Lab's [tutorial](http://cocolab.stanford.edu/mturk-tools.html) or Tim Brady's [video tutorials](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/)

**Basic outline:**

Every HTML document has this basic outline:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
            <!-- The head element contains stuff that will not be displayed -->
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- The body contains the components of the webpage, like text
            or images that are displayed to the user. -->
        </body>
    </html>

  For more details about what goes into the `<head>` element, click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp).
  > Usually, your `<head>` will contain your JavaScript code and your CSS style sheets. These are usually saved as separate documents that are then referenced.

  For example, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` references a CSS document and `<script src="jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>` references a JavaScript document. This is much more organized than having these codes in one huge document.
  
------------------------------------------

## CSS

CSS, or 'Cascading Style Sheets', is a language that allows you to modify the output of HTML content. Usually this is nothing more than creating a 'styles.css' file in which you specify fonts, formatting, and spacing of your html content.

Resources:
* https://www.w3schools.com/css/
* https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/

**Selector Reference:** How do you refer to different HTML elements? See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) for a detailed description of selectors.

- To refer to a specific html element, reference that element's id using `.htmlId{}`.
- To refer to an entire class of html elements, use `#htmlClass{}`.
- To refer to an every single html tag of a certain type, use `htmlTagName{}`. For example, to change the default for everything in the `body` tag you would type `body{}`.

**Specificity:** In the following example, how what color will the `Header2` text be?

Html:

    <body>
      <div id='allMyHeaders'>
        <h1 id='header1' class='headerClass'>
          This is header 1.
        </h1>
        <h2 id='header2' class='headerClass'>
          This is header 2. What color will I be?
        </h2>
      </div>
    </body>

CSS:

```
body{
  color: black;
}

.allMyHeaders{
  color: blue;
}

#headerClass{
  color: green;
}
```

Answer: Since `header2` belongs to `body`, div `allMyHeaders`, AND class `headerClass`, any one of these references could change the font color. In this case `header2` would appear as **green**, for two reasons:

1. CSS always runs top to bottom, so the bottom reference gets priority.
2. CSS also works by specificity. `headerClass` is more *specific* than div `allMyHeaders`, so it gets priority.

Specificity can get confusing pretty quickly, so make sure to always check your code! See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) for a detailed description of specificity.

## Debugging

Debugging your website/MTurk task can be done using your browser. Chrome is probably the most advanced/easiest to use, but all major browsers have debugging tools. **Note: This guide uses Google Chrome, but it is possible in all browsers.**

Step 1: Once you have written some HTML code, you can execute it and view it in your browser.

>In Atom, you can do this by installing the 'script' package and then
pressing 'ctrl + shift + b'. Other editors have this feature as well.

Step 2: In Chrome, right click the document and click 'Inspect', or press 'Ctrl+Shift+I' on Windows or 'Ctrl+Option+J' on Mac.
You can also go to the Chrome browsers menu and then select "More Tools", then select "Developer Tools".

> In fact, you can do this on any website, be it your email, Facebook, or this tutorial! Go ahead and try it, and you can hover over the things in the 'Elements' tab to see which HTML elements correspond to which content on the screen.

Step 3: Debug your code! Make sure the HTML elements are centered properly, and you can use the 'Console' tab for debugging.

>For example, you can use `console.log()` in your JavaScript code to print things directly to the console.

Resources:
* The JavaScript [textbook](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome) has an excellent chapter on this. **Highly Recommended**
* developers.google.com offers this Chrome DevTools [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript).

## Mechanical Turk

Coding experiments specifically with MTurk in mind requires several additional considerations. For example, the code must be able to integrate with MTurk's website, and you need to handle specific issues that might arise when working with MTurkers.

Recommended:

* [MTurk Tutorial](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/) by Timothy Brady.
    - This is also a great tutorial for JavaScript/HTML/CSS as well!  
* MTurk has a [developer guide](https://www.mturk.com/resources)
* [MTurk code samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/mturk-code-samples), including JavaScript code.

Other:
* Lab at Stanford's [tutorial](http://cocolab.stanford.edu/mturk-tools.html)
* If you're using jsPsych - see this [MTurk guide](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/mturk/)

>Note: These are just programming resources, not MTurk resources more generally. See the MTurk Folder for specific information about using MTurk.
