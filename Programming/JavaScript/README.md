# JavaScript Resources

<br />

##  Purpose & Outline

The goal of this folder is to provide helpful resources and suggestions to lab members learning JavaScript for the first time, as well as designating some general conventions and best practices to ensure that members use generally similar coding styles.

## Learning JavaScript

Recommended:
* Free Online [JavaScript Textbook](https://javascript.info/)
* [MTurk with JavaScript Tutorial Videos](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Others:
* Duke's [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web)
* Free/generic [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript)
* Codecademy's JavaScript [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* w3schools.com's [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - not as good as the textbook (I tried both).
* Potentially good, but requires $$ -> [pluralsight.com JS course](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/javascript?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=javascript)
* As always, remember to look up problems you have on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)!

## JavaScript using ATOM

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io/) as your code editor, here are some useful installs that will make your life a lot easier (and help you learn faster!)

* [Useful Atom Packages](http://voidcanvas.com/12-must-have-atom-extensions-to-work-in-javascript/)

If you use another code editor, such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or another, feel free to update this editor with similarly useful information.
