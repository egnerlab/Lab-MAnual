# Task Design Resources (JavaScript)

This document contains useful resources for people attempting to create their own behavioral tasks using JavaScript. **Note:** A basic understanding of JavaScript/HTML/CSS is assumed. See the [JavaScript resource guide](https://github.com/egnerlab/Lab-Manual/Programming/JavaScript-HTML-CSS/README.md) if you need help learning JavaScript.

# jQuery

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a JavaScript library designed to increase HTML manipulability, event handling capabilities, among other features. It is designed to make things like selecting HTML elements (more specifically, [DOM elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) in general) easier and faster.

##### Learning jQuery

The jQuery library is primarily associated with a jQuery [Learning Center](https://learn.jquery.com/), which provides some light jQuery tutorials as well as in depth library documentation. jQuery has become so synonymous with JavaScript programming that many Stack Overflow questions are actually about the jQuery package specifically, without designating them as such. Be careful!

> Recommended Resources:
> * jQuery [learning center](https://learn.jquery.com/)
>   * Excellent documentation and background. Go here for your first look and whenever you need to look up specific jQuery syntax.
> * [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/)
>   * Really good tutorial website for learning the basics of jQuery. Highly recommended!
> * Free Code School [jQuery course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-try-jquery).
>
> *If you find a tutorial you enjoy, feel free to recommend it!*

##### Installing and using jQuery

jQuery can be downloaded from the jquery website, found [here](https://jquery.com/download/). There are a variety of methods to installing jQuery - use the one you are most comfortable with. The download page has excellent instructions.

Once you've installed jQuery, it is important that your HTML document acknowledges and references the jQuery library. To do so, you need to insert a `<script>` tag that references the jQuery.js file.

    <script src="jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>

*Note*: As seen in the example, the file you download from the jQuery website will include a version number. Make source to reference the exact `jquery.js` file, including specifying the path description if you aren't saving `jquery.js` in the same directory as your html file.
