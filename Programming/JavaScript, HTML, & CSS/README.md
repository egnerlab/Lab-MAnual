# JavaScript Resources

##  Purpose & Outline

The goal of this folder is to provide helpful resources and suggestions to lab members learning JavaScript/HTML/CSS for the first time, as well as designating some general conventions and best practices to ensure that members use relatively similar coding styles.

## Learning JavaScript

JavaScript is the dynamic coding language that makes coding experiments possible. While HTML provides the basic structure of a site and CSS the formatting, JavaScript enables highly flexible programming in the conventional sense, allowing you to present stimuli, record reaction times, etc.

If you are learning JavaScript with significant programming experience in another language, the recommended resources plus MTurk specific resources are probably sufficient to get you going, but other more bottom-up resources are also provided.

Recommended:
* Free Online [JavaScript Textbook](https://javascript.info/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/)

Others:
* Duke's [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web)
* Free/generic [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript)
* Codecademy's JavaScript [course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
* w3schools.com's [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - not as good as the textbook (I tried both).
* [pluralsight.com JS course](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/javascript?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=javascript) - potentially good but requires $$
* As always, remember to look up problems you have on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)!

## Programming Experiments for MTurk

Coding experiments specifically with MTurk in mind requires several additional considerations. For example, the code must be able to integrate with MTurk's website. For more general MTurk resources, go to the MTurk Folder (link TBD).

Here are some MTurk-specific JavaScript resources:

* Tim Brady at UCSD gave an excellent [MTurk Programming Lecture](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/)
*


## JavaScript using Atom

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io/) as your code editor, here are some useful installs that will make your life a lot easier (and help you learn faster!)

* [Useful Atom Packages](http://voidcanvas.com/12-must-have-atom-extensions-to-work-in-javascript/)

If you use another code editor, such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or another, feel free to update this editor with similarly useful information.
