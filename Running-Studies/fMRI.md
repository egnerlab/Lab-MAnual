### Becoming eligible to run fMRI studies

1. You'll need to get added to the appropriate medical school IRB protocol. To get added, first sign into iris.duke.edu, which will enter you into the IRB system. The lab manager will then be able to request you getting added to the protocol. To even be eligible for getting added to the IRB, you must complete:

    1. the [CITI training programs](https://www.citiprogram.org/Default.asp). You’ll have to register for an account (one of the first questions that you will be asked is which program you are affiliated with, just choose Duke Health for that), and once you register for Duke Health, it should specify which modules you need to complete.
    2. [these](https://irb.duhs.duke.edu/node/4080) additional tasks if you are an undergraduate
2. If you're running participants, you'll need to get Duke card access so that you can enter the scanning area (and if your Duke card doesn't already have an HID magnet in it, let the lab manager know that you need a new Duke card with one; the magnet is because the fMRI area requires a magnetic tapping of your Duke card rather than scanning of it like, say, most vendors on campus). To get card access:
    1. Complete [the safety quiz](http://www.biac.duke.edu/research/safety/quiz/), which is based on [this tutorial](http://www.biac.duke.edu/research/safety/tutorial.asp) and [this video](http://www.biac.duke.edu/research/safety/safety.asx)
    2. Reach out to Marissa Bruce (marissa.bruce@duke.edu) and let her know you'd like to either meet with her one-on-one or attend a New User Orientation. When you meet with her or attend, bring a completed [screening form](https://www.biac.duke.edu/library/forms/MR_Screening_Form.pdf) and an [SOP acknowledgment form](https://www.biac.duke.edu/library/forms/BIAC_Level_1_MRI_Access_Signature_Sheet.pdf), which requires you to read the [12 SOP's](https://www.biac.duke.edu/research/sop/). For some reason you can't access these PDF's until you already have BIAC access, so just ask someone in lab with BIAC access to open the SOP urls for you.
    3. The lab manager will send an email to biac-help@duke.edu cc'ing you, Tobias, and Marissa Bruce to set up. It will say: <br><br>
```
        To whom this may concern,

        I'm the lab manager in Dr. Tobias Egner's lab, and I’d like to apply for DHE and BIAC access on behalf of a postdoc/(under)graduate student in our lab, XX. (S)he has already attended a new user orientation(or met with Marissa), where they dropped off their MRI screening form and SOP signed agreement.

        When you get a spare moment, could you help set up their DHE and BIAC accounts and then grant them scanner access as well as access to Davison? Below is their information, but as always let me know if you need anything additional.

        Also, Tobias will reply-all to this email granting permission to set up their BIAC accounts and scanner access for the next year.

        First name (and preferred first name):
        Last name:
        Duke NetID:
        Duke UniqueID:
        DukeCard#:
        DukeCard HID#:
        Institution: Duke
        Department: CCN
        Position:
        Current email address:
        Renewal period: 12 months
        BIAC Sponsor: Dr. Tobias Egner
        BIAC Sponsor email: tobias.egner@duke.edu
```

### Setting up a study
1. It's sort of more of a formality, at least compared top the arduous process of getting a medical school IRB approved (don't worry, the lab manager takes care of that), but you still have to get the specific paradigm you're going to be running approved by  BIAC before you can run anyone. Sharena Ballard, BIAC program coordinator, will send an email notifying you of the monthly, upcoming BIAC Scientific Review Committee, which is when your protocol (new and renewals) would get reviewed. This meeting occurs during the first week of each month. The relevant forms/requirements are available [here](http://www.biac.duke.edu/research/gettingstarted.asp), and previously submitted protocols are available on the lab server for reference. Submit the protocol/renewal to research@biac.duke.edu a week before BIAC's review meeting. A couple other details, quoting from one of Sharena's emails:
    1. When submitting, include "The required form, IRB notification of approval (if not already submitted), and copies of the current consent forms."
    2. "If you are submitting a new protocol or your fund code has changed, please be sure to send the fund code/cost object that will fund the study to billing@biac.duke.edu" (you can ask Tobias for this)
2. When your task is ready for the scanner, run a user test (referred to on the online booking schedule as UserTest.01) to make sure the task actually runs in the scanner like you'd hope it would. You can even schedule it less than 24 hours in advance, though if another, paid study schedules for that time that study supersedes the user test. Oh, and the user test is free, which is nice.
3. Create a study folder with a beige manilla folder from the bottom-right cabinet in the lab hall. You'll want the folder to include a log of the participants you run and the following forms (as well as any study-specific surveys/additional paperwork):
    1. [Demographic forms](demographicform.pdf)
    2. [Screening form](https://www.biac.duke.edu/library/forms/MR_Screening_Form.pdf)
    3. Latest fMRI consent form (ask lab manager)
    4. [Edinburgh Handedness Inventory](https://rhd.talkbank.org/protocol/handedness.pdf)

### Preparing to run participants
1. Participants often park at the [parking garage](https://map.concept3d.com?id=21&mrkIid=260305#!m/260305) across the street from the Children's Hospital. We compensate participants for the parking with parking passes that we stash in the top drawer of one of the cabinets in our lab hallway. To request more parking permits follow [these instructions](https://parking.duke.edu/parking/permits/department-permits/departmental-visitors).
2. Tell the lab manager that you're running participants so that (s)he knows to go to the cashier's office to pay participants (you can ask Tobias about an appropriate rate to pay participants). Just let the lab manager know how much money you'll need and what the bill breakdown will be. The lab manager has to return any leftover money to the cashier's office every month, so only ask for the amount that you'll need for the next month.
3. Ask volunteer@biac.duke.edu to advertise your study. You'll provide them with a list of dates and times you're free and which scanner you'd like to use, and they'll add any sign up to the BIAC scanner's corresponding online calendar (you'll receive an automatic email for every new sign up). The first time you correspond, you'll also need to send them this [completed form](mri_study_recruitment_request.docx).
### For each participant you run
1. As soon as you receive sign-up confirmation, check [this list](http://www.biac.duke.edu/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1007) of technicians' availability and see whether only one or more than one tech is operating at that time. If only one, you have to manually create what is called a NULL.01, which prevents someone from scheduling a scan in the other scanner at the same time (only one study can be run if there's only one tech on duty). You just manually create a new event in the other scanner's BIAC calendar called 'NULL.01'. If there's two techs on duty during most of the session, the NULL.01 should only last however long there is only one tech around.
